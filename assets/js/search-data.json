Google organizes the world's information to make it accessible, but there's nothing that does that for personal or institutional information. If search worked in this case, google drive and google docs should be enough for note taking (but they're not). \n\nWe already have a way of managing information at scale. Big software projects are millions of lines of code, but developers are able to work through that complexity with IDEs (integrated development environments) that let them uniformly structure, update, and find specific areas of code. Dendron is taking those same concepts and applying it to general knowledge - we make it possible to enforce a consistent structure across thousands of documents so that you can always find what you need. \n","url":"https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/5c65d3b7-403c-49b2-8161-efb67a491dd2.html","relUrl":"notes/5c65d3b7-403c-49b2-8161-efb67a491dd2.html"},{"doc":"Values","title":"Values","hpath":"handbook.company.values","content":"\n## Summary\n\nThis page describes our values as a company. \n\n## Transparency\n\nWe work in the open. This means that we will be transaparent about what, how, and why we do things. \n\n### In Practice\n- We released Dendron as an open source product\n- We published our handbook for everyone to see\n- We publish our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html) on github \n\n## Customer Obsession\n\nDendron wouldn't exist without its users. At the end of the day, the way we think about what to work on is guided by what would be best for our users.\n\n### In Practice\n- We provide personal onboardings for new users\n- We addressing questions and feedback in [discord](https://discord.gg/AE3NRw9) in near realtime\n- We adjusting and prioritize user feedback when planning our [roadmap](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6e4c4f61-80a3-46fa-9ad3-04b99d9e9695.html)\n\n## Iteration\n\nThe perfect is the enemy of the shipped. We strive to do great work but we will do it incrementally instead of waiting for something to be *perfect*.\n\n### In Practice\n- We publish our work (eg. code, handbook, roadmap) in the process of working on it\n- We push out updates on a [weekly release cycle](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/932534e7-e788-4fdb-bc8c-eaf761992a8d.html)\n- We dedicate a `learnings` section to the end of every project to figure out how to improve the process for next time\n","url":"https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html","relUrl":"notes/b89ba854-72fb-4ebc-a8a0-55960b89e9dc.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"https://handbook.dendron.so/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
